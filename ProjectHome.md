The eID Trust Service is a highly scalable certificate validation service specifically targeting the Belgian eID PKI infrastructure out-of-the-box while remaining configurable to also serve other PKI topologies. The architecture features a harvester and a scheduler to manage a CRL based revocation database in the background.

The eID Trust Service contains an eID Trust Service Portal. Via this portal citizens can verify the validity of their eID certificates online.

The eID Trust Service contains an XKMS2 based web service that allows Third Party applications to verify the validity of eID (authentication) certificate chains. An eID Trust Service SDK should ease integration of the service within Third Party applications.

The eID Trust Service comes with an eID Trust Service Admin Portal. Via this portal the administrator can manage the service.
