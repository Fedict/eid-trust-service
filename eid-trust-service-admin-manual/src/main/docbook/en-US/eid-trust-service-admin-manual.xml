		<para>
			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
			"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
			as shown) are to be interpreted as described in
			<ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">[RFC2119]</ulink>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			The eID Trust Service provides two major service artifacts:
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					eID Trust Service portal
					<para>Via this web portal citizens can check the validity of their
						eID certificates.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					eID Trust Service validation web service
					<para>Via this SOAP web service Relying Parties (aka Service
						Providers) can check the validity of certificate paths. This web
						service is constructed according to the W3C XKMS2 web service
						standard.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			Besides these two service artifacts, the eID Trust Service also comes
			with an Admin portal that allows administrators to manage the eID
			Trust Service via an easy to use web portal interface. In the
			following paragraphs we will use
			<code>$EID_TRUST_SERVICE_ADDRESS</code>
			as the
			(internal) web address where the eID Trust Service product has
			been
			deployed.
		</para>
		<para>
			The source code of the Fedict eID Trust Service is publicly available
			and can be found at
			<ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/eid-trust-service/source/checkout">eID Trust Service Source Code</ulink>
			. Please not that the Fedict eID Trust Service has dependencies on
			jTrust, a java library for trust validation of X509 certificates
			which can be found at
			<ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/jtrust/source/checkout">jTrust source code</ulink>
			.

			<title>Apache configuration under Redhat (Fedora)</title>
			<para>
				Active the Apache HTTP Service via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
			sudo chkconfig --level 345 httpd
			checkconfig --list httpd
			sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
			]]></programlisting>
				Install the SSL via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
				sudo yum install mod_ssl.i686
			]]></programlisting>
				Open up the iptables firewall on the Apache server to allow for both
				HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
				Relevant iptables config lines
				are:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
					-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
				]]></programlisting>
				Check the firewall setting on Redhat (Fedora) via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables
				]]></programlisting>
				Disable the NetworkManager via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop
					sudo chkconfig --level 2345 NetworkManager off
					chkconfig --list NetworkManager
					sudo reboot
				]]></programlisting>
				Enable the (static) network management via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo chkconfig --level 345 network on
					chkconfig --list network
				]]></programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>eID Trust Service Portal</title>
			<para>
				After deployment of the eID Trust Service product, the eID
				Trust
				Service Portal is available at
				<code>$EID_TRUST_SERVICE_ADDRESS/eid-trust-service-portal/</code>
				. This web
				portal MUST be accessed over unilateral SSL. The SSL
				SHOULD be
				terminated on the front-end Apache HTTPD service so that
				the SSL
				information can be communicated to the JBoss Application
				Service
				over AJP. If such a setup is not possible this SHOULD be
				clearly
				communicated in advance to the eID Trust Service development
				team so
				they can properly configure the eID Applet Service that is
				used
				within the eID Trust Service Portal.
			</para>
			<para>
				Add following configuration to your SSL site to accomplish this:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[<IfModule mod_proxy_ajp.c>
                ProxyRequests On
                ProxyVia On

			<title>eID Trust Service Validation Web Service</title>
			<para>
				After deployment of the eID Trust Service product, the eID
				Trust
				Service validation web service is available at
				<code>$EID_TRUST_SERVICE_ADDRESS/eid-trust-service-ws/xkms2</code>
				This web
				service MUST be accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS (thus
				unilateral
				SSL). When this web service is accessed over plain HTTP,
				the service
				provides the possibility to sign the response messages
				using
				WS-Security. This can be configured in the Administrator
				portal.

		<section>
			<title>Java Virtual Machine</title>
			<para>
				You need to have Java Sun 1.6.0_20 or higher installed. JDK or JRE
				are sufficient.
				These can be found at:
				<ulink url="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Java download</ulink>
				.
				After installation you will have to make sure the environment
				variable
				<code>$JAVA_HOME</code>
				is properly set and the
				<code>java</code>
				program is available in the
				<code>$PATH</code>
				. Under Redhat (Fedora) you can create a
				<code>/etc/profile.d/java.sh</code>
				file containing the following:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.6
					export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
				]]></programlisting>
				Check whether the correct JVM is active via the following command:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					java -version
				]]></programlisting>

		<title>Installation</title>
		<abstract>
			This chapter explains how to install the Fedict eID Trust Service
			application.
		</abstract>
		<para>
			The Fedict eID Trust Service has to be run on the
			<ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas">JBoss Application Server</ulink>
			. version 6.0.0.M2.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Fedict eID Trust Service application is delivered in a customized
			database specific zip file. Unpacking this zip file you will notice 2
			directories:
			<code>./jboss</code>
			and
			<code>./sql</code>
			. The
			<code>./jboss</code>
			directory contains the JBoss application server,
			configured for your
			database and pre-packaged with the Fedict eID
			Trust Service
			application. The
			<code>./sql</code>
			directory contains the database
			initialization scripts. MySQL and
			Oracle are supported.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is also possible to run the Fedict eID Trust Service application
			using HSQL, which is the default configured database for the JBoss
			Application Server. You will have to use the JBoss distribution from
			the Fedict eID Applet project. This customized distribution has all
			necessary dependencies included to run the Fedict eID Trust Service.
			To install simply unzip the eID applet JBoss zip and copy the .ear
			file in
			<code>./jboss-as-distribution/server/default/deploy</code>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			Please note that it is not recommended to use this setup in a
			production environment. As the HSQL database is in-memory and parsing
			of large CRL's also is memory intensive, you will run quickly into
			memory problems. 
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Database setup</title>
			<para>
				Before trying to start the JBoss Application Server you will have to
				initialize your database. The initialization scripts can be found
				in
				the
				<code>./sql</code>
				directory. There are 3 scripts, one to create the database account,
				one to create the Fedict eID Trust Service database and one to
				initialize its tables. The default username/password for
				<code>trust</code>
				database is
				<code>trust/trust</code>
				. Please note that if you wish to change this, you will have to
				manually modify the datasource in the JBoss distribution. The
				configuration for this can be found in
				<code>/jboss/server/default/deploy/trust-service-ds.xml</code>
				.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Fedict eID Trust Service has been successfully tested on:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						MySQL v5.0 and v5.1
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>MySQL database setup on Redhat (Fedora)</title>
			<para>
				Following is needed for setting up the MySQL database on Redhat
				(Fedora):
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo yum install mysql-server.i686
					sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start
					sudo mysqladmin -u root password 'secret'
					mysql -u root -p < mysql-create-account.sql
					mysql -u trust -p < mysql-create-database.sql
					mysql -u trust -p trust < mysql-trust-service-ddl.sql
				]]></programlisting>
				Check the database via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					mysql -u trust -p trust
					SHOW tables;
					QUIT;
				]]></programlisting>
				Check whether the MySQL service will be started at boot time via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					chkconfig --list mysqld
				]]></programlisting>
				Enable the MySQL service via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo chkconfig --level 345 mysqld on
				]]></programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Resources</title>
			<para>
				As the harvesting of large CRLs can be memory intensive, the
				JBoss
				Application Server has been tweaked so the JVM can use more
				memory.
				By default it is set to reserve a total of 1GB of heap space.
				The
				configuration can be found in
				<code>./jboss/bin/run.conf</code>
				See
				<link linkend="links">Useful links</link>
				for more info.
			</para>
			<para>
				As to the amount of network traffic, this is highly related as
				to how CRL caching is configured. 
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Starting</title>
			<para>
				After you have correctly setup your database, you can start the
				application by executing following command:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					./jboss/bin/run.sh -b 0.0.0.0
				]]></programlisting>
				. The option
				<code>-b 0.0.0.0</code>
				is to change the bind address of the server so its available to all
				interfaces.
			</para>
			<para>
				After the application has started, it will have initialized itself
				with 4 trust domains.
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						eID Authentication Trust Domain ( machine domain name BE-AUTH )
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						eID Non Repudiation Trust Domain ( machine domain name BE )
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						eID National Registry Trust Domain ( machine domain name
						BE-NAT-REG )
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Belgian TSA Trust Domain ( machine domain name BE-TSA )
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</para>
			<para>
				The default trust domain will be set to the eID Authentication
				Trust Domain. 
			</para>
			<para>
				In order to function properly, the application needs to be able
				to make outgoing calls for CRL, OCSP, TSP and NTP. If you are
				running behind a proxy, you can setup the proxy using the
				administration webapp.
			</para>
			<para>
				CRL downloading for the Belgian eID Trust Domains are typically
				something like
				<code>http://crl.eid.belgium.be/eidc200501.crl</code>
				. The URI is retrieved from the specific certificate.
			</para>
			<para>
				OCSP requests
				for the Belgian eID Trust Domains are sent to
				<code>http://ocsp.eid.belgium.be</code>
				. The URI is again retrieved from the specific certificate.
			</para>
			<para>
				TSP requests
				can be used for clock drift detection and the
				location is
				configurable
				in the Administrator portal.
			</para>
			<para>
				The NTP protocol
				can also be used for clock drift detection and
				again the location is
				configurable in the Administrator portal.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Stopping</title>
			<para>
				Graceful shutdown can be accomplished via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					./jboss/bin/shutdown -s
				]]></programlisting>
				After this you can check if shutdown completed properly via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					ps -ef | grep java
				]]></programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Configuration</title>
		<section>
			<title>Transaction timeouts</title>
			<para>
				The downloading and processing of large CRLs can sometimes take
				a lot
				of time. This can lead to internal transaction timeouts. By
				default,
				the custom JBoss MySQL and Oracle Distributions have a
				transaction
				timeout configured of 1200 seconds or 20 minutes. Which should be
				sufficient.
				If this still proves to be insufficient, this can be
				changed in
				<code>jboss/server/default/deploy/transaction-jboss-beans.xml</code>
				Look for following line and change accordingly:
				<programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
					<property name="defaultTimeout">1200</property>
				]]></programlisting>
				. After changing this the JBoss Application Server has to be
				restarted as followed:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					./jboss/bin/shutdown -s
					./jboss/bin/run.sh -b 0.0.0.0
				]]></programlisting>
				Please note to check if shutdown was completed before starting.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Configuring Redhat (Fedora) as an eID Trust Service</title>
			<para>
				The network interface should not be managed by the NetworkManager
				but should start at boot time. Check that
				<code>/etc/sysconfig/network_scripts/ifcfg_eth0</code>
				contains following lines:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					ONBOOT=yes
					NM_CONTROLLED=no
					USERCTL=no
				]]></programlisting>
				Disable the graphical user interface at startup by setting the
				runlevel in
				<code>/etc/inittab</code>
				to 3:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					id:3:initdefault:
				]]></programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Configuration of the NTP-client on Redhat (Fedora)</title>
			<para>
				Configure your NTP servers via
				<code>/etc/ntp.conf</code>
				.
				Configure the NTP service via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo chkconfig --level 345 ntpd on
					chkconfig --list ntpd
				]]></programlisting>
				Start the NTP service via:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
					sudo /etc/init.d/ntpd start
				]]></programlisting>
				.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>JBoss Logging</title>
			<para>
				The JBoss Application Server's logging configuration can be found in
				<code>./jboss/server/default/deploy/jboss-logging.xml</code>
				.
				All logging from the Fedict eID Trust Service is configured to a
				seperate log file which can be found in
				<code>./jboss/server/default/log/fedict.log</code>
				.
				By default the logging granularity is set to
				<code>DEBUG</code>
				. You can change this by changing the level of the configured Fedict
				logger:
				<programlisting><![CDATA[
  					<logger category="be.fedict">
      					<level name="DEBUG" />
      					<handlers>
         					<handler-ref name="FEDICT" />
      					</handlers>
   					</logger>
   				]]></programlisting>
				In the same way here you can change JBoss' logging too.
			</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Administration</title>
		<section>
			<title>Database</title>
			<para>
				To view the contents of the database behind the FedICT eID Trust
				Service, one can use the
				<ulink url="http://www.squirrelsql.org/">SQuirrel SQL Client</ulink>
				. This SQL client allows you to view the structure of any JDBC
				compliant database.
			</para>
			<para>
				To be able to connect to your HSQL/MySQL/Oracle
				database you will
				need
				to configure a JDBC driver. You can download
				the drivers @
				<ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">MySQL JDBC Driver</ulink>
				and
				<ulink
					url="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html">
					Oracle JDB Driver
				</ulink>
				.
				Configure your driver in SQuirrel SQL by selecting the appropriate
				one, select
				<code>Modify Driver...</code>
				and add your JDBC driver jar in the
				<code>Extra Class Path</code>
				tab.
			</para>
			<para>
				When you are done with this, you can configure the connection to
				the
				database by adding a new
				<code>Alias</code>
				. Select the appropriate driver, and configure the URL, username and
				password as is configured in the FedICT eID Trust Service datasource
				file (
				<code>/jboss/server/default/deploy/trust-service-ds.xml</code>
				).
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Administration Portal</title>
			<abstract>
				The Fedict eID Trust Service comes with an administration
				portal.
				This
				portal allows you to setup your network proxy if any,
				manage
				trust
				domains and other aspects of the service.
			</abstract>
			<section>
				<title>Administrator registration</title>
				<para>
					To authenticate to the administrator portal, an eID
					authentication
					will be performed. If the service was freshly
					installed, the first
					successfull authentication will be
					automatically
					registered as
					administrator. Subsequent administrators
					will have to
					be accepted by
					this one. There are two ways to accomplish this:
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								Perform a login which will add you as a pending
								administrator which can subsequently be approved by an
								administrator.
						</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								Ask another administrator who is logged to register you from
								within the admin portal. You can find this in the
								<link linkend="config_admin" endterm="config_admin.title" />
								.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Configuration</title>
				<section id="config_admin">
					<title id="config_admin.title">Administrators</title>
					<para>Here you can view existing and pending administrators,
						approve
						pending administrators, remove administrators and register
						an
						additional one. To register an additional one, a full eID
						authentication has to be performed of this new administrator.
					</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>WS-Security Configuration</title>
					<para>
						The eID Trust Service Validation Web Service has the
						possibility to optionally sign its response message using
						WS-Security. The keystore to be used for this can be configured
						here. There is support for JKS, PKCS#11 and PKCS#12 keystores. The
						keystore path in case of PKCS#11 is the path to the configuration
						file which will be used by the Sun PKCS#11 provider. 
				</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Network Configuration</title>
					<para>If you are operating behind a proxy, you can setup this in
						here and enable or disable the proxy configuration.
				</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Clock Drift Detection</title>
					<para>
						The Fedict eID Trust Service comes with built in support for
						NTP and TSP. TSP or Timestamp Protocol is a protocol used for
						certifying timestamps. A timestamp request will be sent to the
						configured TSA server, returning a timestamp response containing a
						timestamp token. The received timestamp token will be used
						for
						clock
						drift detection.
				</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Information Message</title>
					<para>
						The information message to be shown on
						<code>$EID_TRUST_SERVICE_ADDRESS/eid-trust-service-portal</code>
						can be
						configured here for all available languages of the FedICT
						eID
						Trust
						Service Portal.
					</para>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Virtual Trust Domains</title>
				<para>
					Virtual trust domains are a group of existing trust domains.
					Users of the eID Trust Service Validation Web Service have the
					possibility to specify a virtual trust domain to validate against
					all of its trust domains configured.
			</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Trust Domains</title>
				<para>
					You can add, modify, remove trust domains here. Also you can
					set the default trust domain for the FedICT eID Trust Service.
					This
					trust domain will be used in the eID Trust Service Validation Web
					Service if no specific trust domain was specified.
					For each trust
					domain you can specify whether or not CRL caching should be used,
					which trust points lie under this trust domain and which
					certificate
					contraints are too be enforced when validating against
					this trust
					domain.
			</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Trust Points</title>
				<para>
					For each trust point, you can specify a cron expression for
					specifying
					the CRL cache refresh interval. Such a refresh includes
					refreshing all
					underlying CA's that have been cached. You can also
					refresh the CRL cache immediately here for debugging purposes. For
					each trust point you can see the list of CA's associated with
					this
					trust point and for each CA refresh the cache individually.
			</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>SNMP</title>
				<para>
					The FedICT eID Trust Service has several SNMP counters
					available.
					These counters can be retrieved by invoking the command:
					<programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
					snmpget -v 2c -c public localhost:7894 1.3.6.1.4.1.7890.0.0
				]]></programlisting>
